        <h3>OSIS SMA</h3>
        <p>Being a part of the student council's music division is a thrilling experience where I contribute to the school's musical vibrancy. 
            From organizing events to collaborating on performances, this role allows me to express my passion for music while fostering unity among students. 
            It's a journey that enhances my organizational and leadership skills, bringing joy to the school through the universal language of music.</p>

        <h3>VOCS</h3>
        <p>I have the honor of being one of the singers as well as the conductor. As part of this choir, we bring harmony into the world of technology and computers. Together, we create beautiful melodies and foster camaraderie among computer science students. As a singer and conductor, this experience not only enriches my musical skills but also strengthens our bonds within the computer science community, proving that beauty can be created across diverse sectors.</p>

        <h3>Pathfinder</h3>
        <p>As a member of Pathfinder, I actively participate in the youth club at the Adventist Church. Within this group, I engage in activities that emphasize character development, leadership skills, and community service, all grounded in Christian values. Through my involvement, I seek spiritual and personal growth while contributing to social service and exploring the outdoors. Being a Pathfinder member has provided me with valuable experiences in understanding religious values and building social responsibility.</p>
